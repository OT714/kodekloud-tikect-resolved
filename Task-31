There is only one success - to be able to spend your life in your own way.

All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination.

Task:
-----
We have a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on the backup server itself, and Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on the same server. Apache and Nginx ports are 5004 and 8099, respectively. We have iptables firewall installed on this server. Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:

We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.

Resolution:
============

# Switch as root user
   sudo su -

   systemctl status iptables

    iptables -L

    iptables start

      iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8099 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

      iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5004 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j REJECT
      systemctl start iptables
    
      systemctl status iptables
     
      service iptables save

      iptables -L
     
      service ipatbles save

      systemctl status iptables
      
     iptables -L
