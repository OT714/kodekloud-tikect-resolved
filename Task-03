Task-3

There are new requirements to automate a backup process that was performed manually by the xFusionCorp Industries system admins team earlier. To automate this task, the team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers, however they did not make it executable on one the app server i.e App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.

Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 3. Also make sure every user can execute it.

Resolution: to solve this ticket i did as follow
=================================================

 chmod 777 /tmp/xfusioncorp


=============================================================================================
Notes:
=====

To give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 3 and make sure every user can execute it, you can use the following command:

-        chmod a+x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh


This will set the executable bit for the owner, group, and others, allowing everyone to execute the script.

Alternatively, if you want to give executable permissions only to the owner and group, but not others, you can use:

-         chmod ug+x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

This will set the executable bit for the owner and group only. In this case, you may also want to make sure that the script is owned by the correct user and group, using the chown command:

-          chown user:group /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

Replace "user" and "group" with the appropriate values for your system.
