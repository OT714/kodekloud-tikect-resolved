Task-13 Create a Cron Job
=========================

You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.

Task:
-----

The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.


Resolution:
===========

Assuming you have administrative privileges on all the Nautilus app servers, you can follow these steps to install the cronie package and start the crond service:

Open a terminal or SSH session to each Nautilus app server.

Update the package list:


- sudo apt-get update
- sudo yum update -y

Install the cronie package:


- sudo apt-get install cronie
- sudo yum install cronie

Once the installation is complete, start the crond service using the following command:


- sudo systemctl start crond

If you want the crond service to start automatically on system boot, enable it using the following command:


sudo systemctl enable crond

Verify that the crond service is running by checking its status using the following command:


- sudo systemctl status crond

This should display the current status of the crond service.

Repeat steps 1-6 for each Nautilus app server.

That's it! You have successfully installed the cronie package and started the crond service on all Nautilus app servers.


B- To add a cron job that runs every 5 minutes and echoes "hello" to the /tmp/cron_text file for the root user, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal or SSH session to the system as the root user.

Edit the root user's crontab file using the following command:


- crontab -e

Add the following line to the crontab file:


- */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text

This will run the echo command every 5 minutes and write "hello" to the /tmp/cron_text file.

Save the changes to the crontab file and exit the editor.

Verify that the cron job has been added by running the following command:


- crontab -l

This should display the current crontab entries for the root user, including the new cron job.

That's it! You have successfully added a cron job that echoes "hello" to the /tmp/cron_text file every 5 minutes for the root user.
