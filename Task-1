Task-1 
=========
create a user in an non interactive mode :

- To create a user with a non-interactive shell, you can use the useradd command with the -s flag to specify the shell. Here's an example command:

useradd -s /bin/false myuser
In this example, the user myuser is created with the shell /bin/false, which is a non-interactive shell that immediately exits when a user logs in. You can replace /bin/false with another non-interactive shell, such as /bin/nologin or /usr/sbin/nologin.

- If you want to create a user without a home directory, you can use the --no-create-home option:

useradd -s /bin/false --no-create-home myuser
This will create the user myuser without a home directory and with the non-interactive shell /bin/false.
