New tools have been installed on the app server in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. Therefore, there are requirements for these app servers.

On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default. Please do not try to reboot these servers


systemctl status runlevel5.target

- To check the default target currently use by your system

           systemctl get-default

- To modify the default behavior of our system i need to vi in :

           /etc/grub2.cfg  
           /etc/dracut.conf

- Difference b/w boot-reboot-shutdown
   - boot   - is when your system is shutdown and you want it to .....
   - reboot - is to bring your running system down and bring it up after that

   - halt   -  is bring all your service down and you will have to bring them up manually
