Task
-----
After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH.

Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.


Solution :
---------

To disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter, you can follow these steps:

Connect to each app server using SSH with an account that has administrative privileges.

Edit the sshd configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config using a text editor such as nano or vi.

Find the line that contains PermitRootLogin yes and change it to PermitRootLogin no.

Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.

Restart the sshd service to apply the changes by running the following command:


sudo systemctl restart sshd

Test the configuration by attempting to SSH into the app server as root. The SSH session should be rejected.

Repeat the above steps for all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.

Note: It is recommended to create a separate administrative account with sudo privileges to perform administrative tasks on the app servers. This way, the root account can be used for emergency access only.
