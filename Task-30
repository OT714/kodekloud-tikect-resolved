Task:
--------

The Nautilus devops team got some requirements related to some Apache config changes. They need to setup some redirects for some URLs. There might be some more changes need to be done. Below you can find more details regarding that:

    httpd is already installed on app server 2. Configure Apache to listen on port 3000.

    Configure Apache to add some redirects as mentioned below:

    a.) Redirect http://stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/ to http://www.stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/ i.e non www to www. This must be a permanent redirect i.e 301

    b.) Redirect http://www.stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/blog/ to http://www.stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/news/. This must be a temporary redirect i.e 302.


Resolution:
============



vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

i

# login and switch to root user
   
   sudo su -


# Check existing config

  rpm -qa |grep httpd
 cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep Listen
   cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep redirect

   # Edit the config file and change the port as per task
   
    vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

  cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep Listen

# For redirect the url will create main.conf 
# Change the port number and server name as per task
     
    ll /etc/httpd/conf.d/
    vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/main.conf
