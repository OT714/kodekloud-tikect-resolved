Real difficulties can be overcome; it is only the imaginary ones that are unconquerable.

Task:
------
During a routine security audit, the team identified an issue on the Nautilus App Server. Some malicious content was identified within the website code. After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. Before doing a cleanup they would like to find all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation. Accomplish the task as per the following requirements:

a. On App Server 3 at location /var/www/html/media find out all files (not directories) having .js extension.

b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /media on same server.

c. Please make sure not to copy the entire /var/www/html/media directory content.


Resolution:
-----------

You can find all the files (not directories) with .js extension in the directory /var/www/html/media on App Server 3 by using the find command with the -type and -name options.

Here is the command you can use:


- find /var/www/html/media -type f -name "*.js"

- find /var/www/html/media -type f -name '*.js' |wc -l

- find /var/www/html/media -type f -name '*.js' -exec cp --parent {} /media \;

This command will search for all files (-type f) with a .js extension (-name "*.js") in the /var/www/html/media directory and its subdirectories.

The output of this command will list all the matching files, with their full path.

To copy all the files with a .js extension in the directory /var/www/html/media on App Server 3 and its subdirectories to the directory /media on the same server, you can use the cp command with the -R and --parents options.

Here is the command you can use:


- cp -R --parents /var/www/html/media/*.js /media/

This command will copy all the files with a .js extension in the directory /var/www/html/media and its subdirectories to the directory /media while preserving their parent directory structure.

The -R option tells the cp command to copy directories recursively. The --parents option tells the cp command to create the parent directory structure of the copied files.

After running this command, all the files with a .js extension in the /var/www/html/media directory and its subdirectories will be copied to the /media directory with their parent directory structure preserved.

Sure, to avoid copying the entire /var/www/html/media directory content, you can modify the cp command as follows:


- cp -R --parents /var/www/html/media/**/*.js /media/

This command will only copy files with a .js extension in the /var/www/html/media directory and its subdirectories, while preserving their parent directory structure, to the /media directory on the same server.

The ** in the path pattern allows the command to search for files in all subdirectories of /var/www/html/media.

With this command, you will only copy the files with a .js extension and their parent directory structure to the /media directory, without copying any other files or directories in the /var/www/html/media directory.
