Task-37:  IPtables Installation And Configuration
==================================================

You don’t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and falling over.

– Richard Branson

Task:
-------

We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apache’s port i.e 5004 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

    Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

    Block incoming port 5004 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.

    Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.


    Resolution:
    ------------
  
  sudo su 

  yum install iptables -y

  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5004 -s <LBRip@> -j ACCEPT
     - iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5004 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT

  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5004  -j DROP

  iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables

  cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables

  grep 5004 /etc/sysconfig/iptables

  Apply this configuration on all appservers
