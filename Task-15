Task-15 : Linux User Expiry
===========================

The greatest glory in living, lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.

– Nelson Mandela

Task:
-----

A developer javed has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for javed. It’s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named javed on the App Server 2. Set expiry date to 2021-01-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.


Resolution:
-----------

Create a new user named Javed:

- sudo adduser javed

Press Enter and follow the prompts to set a password for the new user.

To set the expiry date for the user, use the following command:

- sudo chage -E 2021-01-28 javed

Verify that the user has been created and the expiry date has been set correctly by running the following command:

- sudo chage -l javed
