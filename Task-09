Tasks-9 Linux User Without Home
===============================
Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.

â€“ Walt Whitman

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except for App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.

Create a user named james in App Server 2 without a home directory.


Solution:
=========

To create a user named "james" in App Server 2 without a home directory, you can use the useradd command with the -M option to prevent the creation of a home directory.

Here are the steps to create the "james" user without a home directory:

Log in to App Server 2 as a user with sudo privileges.

Open a terminal window.

Run the following command to create the "james" user without a home directory:


#     sudo useradd -M james

This command uses the useradd command with the -M option to create the "james" user without a home directory.

After running the command, the "james" user will be created without a home directory.

It's important to note that without a home directory, the user won't have a place to store files and configuration files that are typically located in a user's home directory. If the user needs a home directory later, you can create one for them using the mkdir command and then update the user's home directory using the usermod command.
