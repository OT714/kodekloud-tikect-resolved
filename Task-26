Task-26: Configure Local Yum repos
=================================

For success attitude is equally important as ability.

â€“ Harry F.Bank


Task:
------

The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named localyum and make sure to set Repository ID to localyum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package httpd from this newly created repo.


Resolution:
-------------

Create a directory to store the repository metadata:

- sudo mkdir /var/www/html/localyum

Copy all the RPM packages to this directory:

- sudo cp /packages/downloaded_rpms/*.rpm /var/www/html/localyum/

Install the createrepo package if it's not already installed:

sudo yum install createrepo -y

Run the createrepo command to generate the repository metadata:

- sudo createrepo /var/www/html/localyum/

Create a new repository configuration file:

- sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/localyum.repo

Add the following lines to the file:

[localyum]
name=localyum
baseurl=file:///var/www/html/localyum
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

Save and exit the file.

Run the following command to clear the yum cache:


- sudo yum clean all

Verify that the localyum repository is available and enabled:

- sudo yum repolist

You should now be able to use the localyum repository to install packages using the yum command.






Install package httpd from this newly created repo

To install the package httpd from the newly created localyum repository, you can follow these steps:

Make sure that the localyum repository is enabled. You can check this by running the following command:

- sudo yum repolist

If the localyum repository is not enabled, enable it by running the following command:


- sudo yum-config-manager --enable localyum

Once the repository is enabled, you can install the httpd package using the following command:

- sudo yum install httpd

The yum command will automatically download and install the httpd package along with any dependencies required by it.

Once the installation is complete, start the httpd service:


- sudo systemctl start httpd

You should now have successfully installed the httpd package from the newly created localyum repository.
