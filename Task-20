Solution:
----------

if you are seeing an error message "Job for postfix.service failed because the control process exited with error code" when trying to start the Postfix mail service, it means that the service failed to start due to some issue. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check the Postfix service status: Run the following command to check the status of the Postfix service:
sudo systemctl status postfix
This will display information about the status of the service, including whether it is active and running or if there are any errors or issues.

Check the Postfix configuration: Postfix relies heavily on its configuration file, which is typically located 
at /etc/postfix/main.cf. 

i found that :
inet_interfaces = localhost

I change it to all :

inet_interfaces = all 
service postfix restart
systemctl status postfix



Check the configuration file for any errors or syntax issues. You can do this by running the following command:

sudo postfix check

This command will check the Postfix configuration file for any errors and provide feedback if it finds any.

Check system logs: System logs can often provide clues as to why a service failed to start. Check the system logs for any messages related to the Postfix service. On most Linux systems, system logs are located in the /var/log directory. You can view the logs by running the following command:
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
This will display the last few lines of the syslog, including any messages related to the Postfix service.

Restart the server: If all else fails, try restarting the server to see if this resolves the issue. Run the following command to restart the server:
sudo reboot

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to consult the Postfix documentation or a system administrator for further assistance.
