Task-29: Linux GPG Encryption
=============================

An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.

â€“ Benjamin Franklin


Task:
-----

We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.

On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. Use those keys to perform the following actions.

    Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.

    Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).


Resolution:
------------

Steps
-----
 # Switch to root user
       - sudo su -
       - cd /home/
         ll
 #  To import the keys on the server  
       - gpg --import /home/public_key.asc

       - gpg --import /home/private_key.asc
          gpg --list-keys
          gpg --list-secret-keys

 #  Encrypt file
       
      -  gpg --encrypt -r kodekloud@kodekloud.com --armor < encrypt_me.txt -o encrypted_me.asc
         ll
   
 #  Decrypt file
   
      -  gpg --decrypt decrypt_me.asc > decrypted_me.txt
         ll

 #  Verify 
     
       cat encrypt_me.txt 
       cat encrypted_me.asc 
       cat decrypt_me.asc 
       cat decrypted_me.txt
